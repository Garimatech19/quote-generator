## Additional Notes
- **API Usage:** The application fetches quotes from `https://dummyjson.com/quotes`.
- **Local Storage:** Favorites are stored in local state but reset on page reload.
- **Mobile Adaptation:** The favorite quotes drawer adjusts responsively to avoid overlap.

## Assumptions
- The API will always return valid quotes.
- The user wants to clear favorites on page reload.
- The UI should prioritize accessibility and responsiveness.
